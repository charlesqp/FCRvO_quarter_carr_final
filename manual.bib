abstract = {Abstract This paper presents an elementary solution to the non-singular H∞ control problem. In this control problem, the underlying linear system satisfies a set of assumptions which ensures that the solution can be obtained by solving just two algebraic Riccati equations of the game type. This leads to the central solution to the H∞ control problem. The solution presented in this paper uses only elementary ideas beginning with the Bounded Real Lemma.},

abstract = {A new robust stability condition for uncertain discrete-time systems with convex polytopic uncertainty is given. It enables to check stability using parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions which are derived from LMI conditions. It is shown that this new condition provides better results than the classical quadratic stability. Besides the use of a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function, this condition exhibits a kind of decoupling between the Lyapunov and the system matrices which may be explored for control synthesis purposes. A numerical example illustrates the results.}

abstract = {This paper provides new dilated linear matrix inequality (LMI) characterizations for continuous-time controller synthesis. The dilated LMIs enable us to parametrize controllers without involving the Lyapunov variables in the parametrizations. Taking advantage of this feature, we can readily design multiobjective controllers with non-common Lyapunov variables, whereas we are forced to employ a common one in the well-known Lyapunov shaping paradigm. In particular, it is shown that the proposed dilated-LMI-based approach to H2/D-stability synthesis encompasses the corresponding Lyapunov shaping paradigm as a special case. In this sense, the results of this paper can be viewed as partial counterparts of those obtained in the discrete-time setting.}

abstract = {This paper deals with the H∞ guaranteed cost control problems for continuous-time uncertain systems. It consist of the determination of a stabilizing state feedback gain which imposes on all possible closed-loop models an H∞ -norm upper bound γ > 0. Assuming that the uncertain domain is convex-bounded and the uncertain system is quadratic-stabilizable with γ disturbance attenuation, it is shown how to determine, by means of a convex programming problem, the global minimum of γ. As a particular and important case, for precisely known linear systems, the last problem reduces to the classical H∞ optimal control problem. The results follow from the definition of a special parameter space on which the above-mentioned problems are convex.}
